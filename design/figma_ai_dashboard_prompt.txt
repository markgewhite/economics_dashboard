DESIGN BRIEF: UK HOUSING & ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DASHBOARD

=== PROJECT OVERVIEW ===

Create a professional economic data dashboard for desktop web that visualizes the relationship between UK monetary policy, housing markets, and economic indicators. This is a portfolio piece demonstrating data science capabilities, so the design should feel authoritative and sophisticated while remaining approachable.

=== DESIGN AESTHETIC ===

Look and Feel:
- Professional and trustworthy, similar to Bloomberg Terminal or Bank of England publications
- Modern and clean, not corporate or sterile
- Data-focused with high information density, but not overwhelming
- Conveys financial authority while being accessible to non-specialists

Style References:
- Financial data terminals (Bloomberg, Reuters)
- Government statistics dashboards (ONS, Federal Reserve)
- Modern SaaS analytics platforms (Stripe Dashboard, Amplitude)

Overall Impression:
The design should feel like a tool a serious financial analyst or property investor would use daily. It prioritizes clarity, efficiency, and trust over flashiness.

=== LAYOUT STRUCTURE ===

The dashboard follows a clear visual hierarchy with four main sections:

1. HEADER (Fixed at top)
   - Dashboard branding/logo on left
   - Title: "UK Housing & Economic Conditions Dashboard"
   - Last updated timestamp
   - Refresh action

2. HERO METRICS SECTION
   - Four prominent key metrics in a horizontal row
   - Each shows: icon, label, large value, change indicator (up/down arrow with %)
   - Metrics are: Bank Rate, 2yr Mortgage Rate, Average House Price, CPI Inflation
   - These are the "at-a-glance" numbers that matter most

3. INTERACTIVE CONTROLS
   - Time range selector (6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, all)
   - Region filter dropdown

4. MAIN CONTENT AREA
   Two-column layout with left column wider than right (roughly 60/40 split)
   
   LEFT COLUMN (Primary visualizations):
   - Large chart: "Interest Rates & House Prices" - dual-axis line chart showing correlation
   - Large chart: "Regional House Price Changes" - UK heat map showing geographic variation
   
   RIGHT COLUMN (Supporting data):
   - Medium chart: "Mortgage Rate Trends" - three overlapping lines
   - Medium chart: "Transaction Volumes" - bar chart showing market activity
   - Compact metrics card: "Key Economic Indicators" with three mini metrics (CPI, Employment, Retail)

5. DEEP DIVE PANELS (Bottom section)
   Three equal-width panels in a row:
   - Panel 1: "Housing Market Composition" with tabs and donut chart showing breakdowns
   - Panel 2: "Economic Context" with small trend charts for GDP, unemployment, confidence
   - Panel 3: "Regional Spotlight" with dropdown to explore specific regions in detail

6. FOOTER
   - Data source attribution
   - Portfolio credit

=== CONTENT REQUIREMENTS ===

Charts/Visualizations Needed:
1. Dual-axis line chart (time series with two Y-axes)
2. UK regional heat map (choropleth)
3. Multi-line chart (3 overlapping trends)
4. Column/bar chart (monthly volumes)
5. Mini sparkline charts (3 small trend indicators)
6. Donut chart (composition breakdown)
7. Horizontal comparison bars (regional benchmarking)

Interactive Elements:
- Time range button group (toggle between periods)
- Region dropdown selector
- Tabs for switching views
- Chart tooltips on hover
- Clickable legend items

Data Display Patterns:
- Large prominent numbers (hero metrics)
- Up/down indicators with color coding (positive = green, negative = red)
- Percentage changes with directional arrows
- Comparison to baseline/average
- Sparklines showing recent trends

=== FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS ===

Visual Hierarchy:
Most important → Least important
1. Hero metrics (largest, most prominent)
2. Main correlation chart (left column, top)
3. Supporting charts (right column, medium size)
4. Deep dive panels (bottom, detailed exploration)

Information Density:
- Pack information efficiently without feeling cluttered
- Use white space strategically to create breathing room
- Group related information visually
- Use cards/panels to contain distinct data sets

Interaction Patterns:
- Time range selection affects all time-based charts
- Region selection filters relevant geographic data
- Hover reveals detailed tooltips
- Tabs switch between different views of the same data type
- Clear visual feedback for interactive elements

Data Relationships to Emphasize:
- Causation: Interest rates → mortgage rates → house prices → economic impact
- Geographic variation: Different regions respond differently
- Time-based trends: Historical patterns and recent changes
- Composition: Market makeup by type, buyer, payment method

=== RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR ===

Desktop (primary): Full layout as described
Tablet: Convert two-column to single column, stack panels vertically
Mobile: Simplified view with priority content first, reduced chart complexity

=== ACCESSIBILITY ===

- All interactive elements should have clear affordances
- Sufficient color contrast for readability
- Icons should be supplemented with text labels
- Support keyboard navigation
- Provide alternative text for data visualizations

=== BRANDING NOTES ===

This is a personal portfolio project, so:
- Design should feel professional but not corporate-branded
- Emphasis on clarity and data visualization quality
- Should demonstrate technical sophistication
- Attribution to data sources (Bank of England, HM Land Registry, ONS) in footer

=== DESIGN DELIVERABLES NEEDED ===

1. Desktop layout (1440px viewport)
2. Component states (default, hover, active)
3. Sample data visualizations for each chart type
4. Responsive layouts (tablet, mobile)
5. Tooltip designs
6. Loading states

=== KEY SUCCESS CRITERIA ===

The design succeeds if:
1. A financial professional immediately understands what they're looking at
2. The relationship between interest rates and housing is visually clear
3. Navigation and filtering feel intuitive
4. Data density is high but comprehensible
5. The overall impression is "this person knows what they're doing"

Create a desktop web dashboard design that balances professional authority with modern usability, optimized for displaying economic time-series data and geographic variations.
